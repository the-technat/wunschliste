There are a number of ways to add images to a note:

Using the 'Insert image' button in the editor toolbar.
Dragging and dropping an image file into the editor.
Copying and pasting an image into the editor.
These images are then uploaded to a folder named "attachments" located within your flatnotes data folder. Note: If this folder doesn't exist, it is created on startup.

All files in the attachments folder are accessible at `/attachments/<filename>`. For example, if you have an image named `my-image.png` in the attachments folder, you can access it at `https://www.your-flatnotes-url.com/attachments/my-image.png`.

Currently, there is no way to view or delete files in the attachments folder from flatnotes and they are not deleted when the note is deleted. You will need to manually delete them from the folder as required.
